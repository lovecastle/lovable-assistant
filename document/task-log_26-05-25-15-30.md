## TASK: 
Refactor the lovable-detector.js file into smaller, focused components to improve maintainability while keeping all functionality intact.

## GOAL: 
- Remove orphaned files from previous refactoring attempts
- Add clear section headers throughout the main file for better organization
- Improve code maintainability without breaking Chrome extension compatibility
- Preserve all existing functionality

## IMPLEMENTATION:

### 1. Orphaned File Cleanup:
- **Removed**: `helpers.js` (not loaded by manifest)
- **Removed**: `lovable-detector-refactored.js` (incomplete refactoring attempt)
- **Removed**: `message-scraper.js` (not integrated with manifest)
- **Kept**: Only files actually loaded by Chrome extension manifest

### 2. Section Header Organization:
Added comprehensive section headers to `lovable-detector.js`:

- **SECTION 1**: Core Detector Class (page detection, shortcuts)
- **SECTION 2**: UI Dialog Management (dialog creation, styling, navigation)
- **SECTION 3**: Chat Interface (message handling, Claude API integration)
- **SECTION 4**: Conversation History Management (database loading, filtering)
- **SECTION 5**: Utilities Management (settings, prompt enhancement)
- **SECTION 6**: Comprehensive Message Scraper (intelligent scrolling, batch processing)
- **SECTION 7**: Initialization (extension startup and global access)

### 3. Subsection Headers:
Added focused subsection headers for helper methods:
- UI Helper Methods (formatMessage, styling functions)
- Communication Helper Methods (safeSendMessage, error handling)

### 4. Benefits Achieved:
- ✅ Improved code navigation and readability
- ✅ Clear separation of responsibilities
- ✅ Better maintainability for future development
- ✅ Preserved all existing functionality
- ✅ Maintained Chrome extension compatibility
- ✅ No complex file dependencies introduced
