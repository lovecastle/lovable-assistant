## Task: Remove Notification System
**TASK:** Completely remove the notification system out of the project with every related code because it's no longer needed.

**GOAL:** To remove all notification-related functionality, code, and UI elements from the Lovable.dev Assistant Chrome Extension, making the codebase leaner and more focused on its core features.

**IMPLEMENTATION:**

1. Removed notification monitoring functions from `lovable-detector.js`:
   - Removed `setupLovableResponseMonitoring()`
   - Removed `checkWorkingElementExistence()`
   - Removed `findWorkingElement()`
   - Removed `onLovableResponseComplete()`
   - Removed `showLovableCompletionNotification()`
   - Removed `createNotification()`
   - Removed `switchToLovableTab()`
   
2. Removed the call to `setupLovableResponseMonitoring()` in the `init()` method

3. Removed references to `monitoringInterval` in the `destroy()` method

4. Removed notification UI elements from the utilities page:
   - Removed the entire Notifications section with toggle switches
   - Removed notification-related toggle setup in `setupUtilitiesEvents()`
   
5. Updated utility settings methods to remove notification references:
   - Updated `loadUtilitiesSettings()` to remove notification settings
   - Updated `resetUtilitiesSettings()` to remove notification localStorage items
   - Updated `exportUtilitiesSettings()` to remove notification properties

**COMPLETED:** May 29, 2025, 10:15 AM

**RESULTS:**
- Codebase is now more streamlined with the removal of unused notification functionality
- UI is cleaner with one fewer section in the utilities page
- LocalStorage usage is reduced by eliminating notification-related settings
- Extension will no longer request notification permissions from the browser
