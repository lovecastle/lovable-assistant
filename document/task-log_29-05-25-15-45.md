# Task Log: Lovable.dev Assistant Chrome Extension

## TASK: Fix message scraping in Lovable.dev chat interface
Implement a solution to properly detect and scrape messages from the Lovable.dev chat interface, which currently fails with "Error during scraping: Could not find chat container."

## GOAL: 
Create a robust message detection and extraction system that can reliably capture both user messages and AI responses from the Lovable.dev interface, properly pairing them and extracting all relevant metadata.

## IMPLEMENTATION:
Created an updated version of the conversation-capture-simple.js file with:
1. More flexible DOM selectors that can adapt to Lovable.dev's current structure
2. Improved message detection logic for both user and AI messages
3. Robust content extraction that handles different message formats
4. Reliable message pairing system to associate user questions with AI responses
5. Comprehensive error handling with fallback mechanisms
6. Diagnostic capabilities to assist with troubleshooting
