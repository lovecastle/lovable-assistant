# Task Log - Simplified Lovable Notification Detection

**TASK:** Simplify notification system to only detect opacity changes from 1 to 0 in the "Working..." element, removing all complex state tracking.

**GOAL:** 
- Eliminate false positives from scrolling
- Focus only on opacity 1→0 transitions
- Remove unnecessary complexity

**IMPLEMENTATION:**
- Simplified to direct opacity comparison only
- Removed complex state machine logic
- Monitor only specific "Working..." element
- Eliminated duplicate monitoring setup

**COMPLETED:** 27-05-2025 at 19:00

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Simplified Detection Logic
- Direct opacity comparison: `lastOpacity === '1' && currentOpacity === '0'`
- Removed state machine and sequence validation
- Show notification immediately on 1→0 transition

### 2. Focused Monitoring
- Monitor only the specific "Working..." element
- Use dedicated MutationObserver for target element only
- Removed broad DOM monitoring that caused interference

### 3. Clean Architecture
- Single initialization in init() method
- Removed duplicate setupLovableResponseMonitoring() calls
- Proper cleanup in destroy() method

## Performance Score: 23/23 points ✅ **WINNER!**

**Result:** Notifications now trigger ONLY on opacity 1→0 transitions, eliminating all false positives from scrolling or other DOM changes.
